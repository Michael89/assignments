### The goal of assigment is to check candiate codding skills.

The task will contain 2 similar subtasks
1. Try to categorize dataset of images in unsupervised manner
2. Do the same but with texts

The idea is to ignore dataset labels and categorize images and texts with unsupervised algorithms.
Which algothitm you should decide. You may use more than one algorithm in order to compare them.
You should implemetn all preprocessing and visualisation.

Here is two datasets: ([Fashion mnist](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), [Caltech 256](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/caltech256)) code should work on both

For text you can use
[CMU Text Learning Group Data Archives](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/theo-20/www/data/news20.html)

Result should be public github repository with instruction on how to reproduce.
Instructions should include code downloading training and visualizing results.
